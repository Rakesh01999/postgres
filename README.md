# SQL Date and Time Operations

A comprehensive guide to working with dates, times, and timestamps in SQL with practical examples. This repository extends the SQL Students Database Tutorial with focused content on date and time manipulation in PostgreSQL.

- [Database Configuration](#database-configuration)
- [Timestamp Types](#timestamp-types)
- [Current Date and Time](#current-date-and-time)
- [Date and Time Formatting](#date-and-time-formatting)

## üìö Introduction

Date and time manipulation is a crucial aspect of database operations. This guide demonstrates PostgreSQL's capabilities for handling temporal data, including timezone management, formatting, calculation, and extraction of components from dates.

## üåê Database Configuration

### Checking Current Timezone

Before working with dates and times, it's important to know your database's timezone configuration:

```sql
SHOW timezone;
```

## ‚è∞ Timestamp Types

PostgreSQL offers two main timestamp types:

- `TIMESTAMP without time zone` - Stores date and time without timezone information
- `TIMESTAMP with time zone` - Stores date and time with timezone information

### Creating a Table with Both Timestamp Types

```sql
CREATE Table timez (
    ts TIMESTAMP without time zone, 
    tsz TIMESTAMP with time zone
);
```

### Inserting Timestamp Data

```sql
INSERT INTO timez VALUES('2024-01-12 10:45:00', '2024-01-12 10:45:00');
```

### Viewing Timestamp Data

```sql
SELECT * FROM timez;
```

## üìÖ Current Date and Time

PostgreSQL provides several functions to get the current date and time:

```sql
-- Current date and time with timezone
SELECT now();

-- Current date only
SELECT CURRENT_DATE;

-- Extract date from timestamp
SELECT now()::date;

-- Extract time from timestamp
SELECT now()::time;
```

## üî§ Date and Time Formatting

The `to_char()` function allows formatting dates in various ways:

```sql
-- Format date as day/month/year
SELECT to_char(now(), 'dd/mm/yyyy');

-- Get month name (lowercase)
SELECT to_char(now(), 'month');

-- Get month name (uppercase)
SELECT to_char(now(), 'MONTH');

-- Get day name (uppercase)
SELECT to_char(now(), 'DDDD');

-- Get day name (lowercase)
SELECT to_char(now(), 'dddd');
```

## ‚ûï Date Arithmetic

PostgreSQL makes it easy to perform date arithmetic using the `INTERVAL` keyword:

```sql
-- Subtract one year from current date
SELECT CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year';

-- Subtract one month from current date
SELECT CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 month';

-- Subtract one year and two months from current date
SELECT CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year 2 month';
```

## üßÆ Age Calculation

The `age()` function calculates the difference between two dates:

```sql
-- Calculate age from birth date
SELECT age(CURRENT_DATE, '1996-07-29');
```

### Practical Application: Student Age Calculation

```sql
-- Calculate age of all students
SELECT *, age(CURRENT_DATE, dob) FROM students;
```

## üîç Date Component Extraction

The `extract()` function allows extraction of specific components from dates:

```sql
-- Extract day
SELECT extract(day from '2024-01-25'::date);

-- Extract month
SELECT extract(month from '2024-01-25'::date);

-- Extract year
SELECT extract(year from '2024-01-25'::date);
```

## üîÑ Boolean Conversions

PostgreSQL allows conversion of certain string values to boolean:

```sql
-- Convert string to boolean
SELECT 'n'::BOOLEAN;
```

## üìù Example Queries

Here are some practical examples combining date operations:

1. **Find students born in a specific month:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM students 
   WHERE extract(month from dob) = 7;
   ```

2. **Calculate average age by course:**
   ```sql
   SELECT course, AVG(extract(year from age(CURRENT_DATE, dob))) as average_age 
   FROM students 
   GROUP BY course 
   ORDER BY average_age DESC;
   ```

3. **Format students' birthdays nicely:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       first_name, 
       last_name, 
       to_char(dob, 'Month DD, YYYY') as birthday 
   FROM students;
   ```

4. **Find students who have birthdays next month:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM students 
   WHERE extract(month from dob) = extract(month from CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '1 month');
   ```

## üìö Overview

This project contains SQL queries that demonstrate how to analyze student data using PostgreSQL's powerful aggregation and filtering capabilities. The queries progressively build in complexity, showing how to extract meaningful insights from demographic and geographical data.

## üîå Database Connection

The queries connect to a PostgreSQL database with the following connection string:
```
Active: 1743601378217@@127.0.0.1@5432@test_db@public
```

This indicates a connection to:
- Host: 127.0.0.1 (localhost)
- Port: 5432 (default PostgreSQL port)
- Database: test_db
- Schema: public

## üßÆ Queries Explained

### Basic Data Retrieval

```sql
-- Retrieve all student records
SELECT * FROM students;

-- Extract list of countries represented in the dataset
SELECT country FROM students;
```

### Country-based Analysis

```sql
-- Count students by country
SELECT country, count(*) FROM students
    GROUP BY country;

-- Calculate average age by country
SELECT country, count(*), avg(age) FROM students
    GROUP BY country;
```

### Filtered Aggregations with HAVING

```sql
-- Filter groups using HAVING to show only countries with average age above 20
SELECT country, count(*), avg(age) FROM students
    GROUP BY country
        HAVING avg(age) > 20;

-- Filter groups using HAVING with more precise threshold (20.97)
SELECT country, count(*), avg(age) FROM students
    GROUP BY country
        HAVING avg(age) > 20.97;
```

### Date-based Analysis

```sql
-- Count students born in each year
SELECT extract(year FROM dob) as birth_year
    FROM students
    GROUP BY birth_year;

-- Get count of students by birth year
SELECT extract(year FROM dob) as birth_year, count(*)
    FROM students
    GROUP BY birth_year;
```

## üöÄ Usage

To execute these queries:

1. Connect to your PostgreSQL database using a client like pgAdmin, DBeaver, or the command line
2. Copy and paste the desired query
3. Execute the query to view the results

## üóÑÔ∏è Schema Information

These queries work with a `students` table that appears to have at least the following columns:
- Various student attributes (implicitly retrieved with `SELECT *`)
- `country` (VARCHAR) - Student's country of origin
- `age` (INT) - Student's age
- `dob` (DATE) - Student's date of birth

This project builds upon concepts from the "SQL Students Database Tutorial" which provides a more comprehensive explanation of the database schema and operations.
